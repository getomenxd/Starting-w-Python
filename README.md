Waaazaaap! 😝

I'm Getomenxd (Sergi to friends), and this is my GitHub repository. I recently graduated in Biotechnology, and the purpose of this repository is to show the world what I’m learning about programming on my own.

I know there are many programming languages, but I'm mainly focused on Python. Why? Well, during my degree, I took a few bioinformatics lessons, specifically covering Python basics and its syntax. It was cool and interesting, as far as I remember, so I want to keep building my skills. Beyond my personal interest in programming, I want to learn Python because I believe it could be a valuable skill for my professional career. My long-term goal is to work in the biological field, specifically in the analysis and interpretation of biological data.

One day, I hope to be able to say I'm an expert in biological data analysis—not only with Python, but also with R and other languages! For now, though... it’s time to work hard to make those dreams come true 😄.

Let's gooo! 🏁
